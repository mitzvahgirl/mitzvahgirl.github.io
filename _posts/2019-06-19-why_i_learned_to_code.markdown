My mother was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease at the age of 58 and passed away last year at the age of 72. Both of my maternal grandparents also passed away at different points from complications from Alzheimer’s-related dementia. I cannot remember a time when Alzheimer’s disease was not part of my life.

As such, I try to take care of myself by exercising and eating as well as I can, two of the three main ways that have been shown can delay the onset of Alzheimer’s. The third recommended way is to do mental activities to maintain cognitive health. I have tried Luminosity and other “brain games.” I do enjoy word games, though I don’t always have too much time to sit and work on a crossword puzzle.

I was also at the point at which I believed a slight pivot within my chosen field of theatre would give me an an advantage over the competition. I started to take a number of online classes and tutorials in different subjects in order to upskill. One day I tried an Intro to HTML5 and CSS3 course. I had taken an introductory CS class in college and learned Basic, but this was like starting from scratch. I flew through that class and then I attempted the Intermediate section and finally moved on to the Advanced class. It was sometimes frustrating, but ultimately satisfying to see how I could create and move objects across the screen.

I began to build things on Codepen with my new skills and to create a portfolio of theatre-related projects. I knew that only learning HTML and CSS would not be enough to get me a job designing websites or coding even as a junior developer for a tech startup. I needed to dig in to JavaScript. JavaScript is not an easy language for beginners who are self-taught. I know I learn better within a structured class environment (either traditional or online) and want the accountability of assignments and projects, as well as the access to mentors and extra help.

In November of 2017, I saw an ad on Facebook and applied for the Grow with Google Developers Challenge on Udacity. As part of the application Udacity asked for a mission statement. My answer: to learn how to build digital products for theatre. After the challenge, I made it into the second cohort and won a six-month scholarship for a Nanodegree in Front End Web Development. I completed the program in November of 2018.

The more I learned, the more I realized how much more I still needed to learn and wanted to push myself to the next level. Recently, I saw an announcement about Flatiron School’s new 50/50 program, a partnership with SeatGeek, to increase the number of women in tech. I applied, had an interview via video chat and was awarded a partial scholarship. I will be starting the part-time, online bootcamp in Software Development next month, June, 2019. Once finished, I will receive a certificate which will affirm my skills and knowledge as a full stack developer.

Learning to code teaches the student how to solve problems programmatically, by breaking the problems down into smaller chunks and connecting them, resulting in a total functional product, usually a website or an app, or a voice-driven skill or message chatbot. Learning to code has been compared to learning a foreign language, another recommended mental challenge to delay Alzheimer’s symptoms.

To my knowledge, I will be the first and only individual to hold an advanced theatre management degree in addition to being a full stack software developer. With this skillset, I will be able to contextualize theatre content and add interactivity for the web, both graphically and with voice-driven technology. I am constantly pushing my![](![](http://)http://)self to learn more and do more. And beyond that, I would like to help others learn to code, as well.

I don’t know what the future will hold as far as my possibly developing Alzheimer’s disease or how much time I will have if, unfortunately, the disease does take hold. I hope my family or friends do not have to witness my decline the way I did my mother and my grandparents’ long deterioration. It is brutal and heartbreaking and there is still no cure.

I also fear forgetting what it feels like to sit in a theatre and experience the communal feeling of joy while watching art on stage or on a screen. This is what drives me to learn and to push the needle forward.

One of my goals for my portfolio and for the Flatiron School, is to relate each project to a theatre-related ideaor  "user 

problem." As such, I chose to create a CLI data gem that provides the user with information scraped from 

www.broadway.com. 



The data from this site was scraped using the module Open-URI, which returns the HTML content of the particular URL, 

and Nokogiri, a Ruby gem which parses through the HTML and returns the item of interest, based on the use of CSS 

selectors.

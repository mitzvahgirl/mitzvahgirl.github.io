<p>I recently received a scholarship for the Flatiron School's full stack software engineering program as part of Flatiron School’s Women Take Tech initiative. In November of 2018, I completed a Nanodegree in Front End Web Development after winning a Grow with Google Scholarship. I am focusing on voice-first technology for theatre applications.</p>

<p>In addition, I am skilled in digital marketing and certified in Google Analytics, Google Adwords Fundamentals and Mobile, as well as Hubspot Inbound Marketing. </p>

<p>I have a Bachelor of Science in Film Studies from Boston University’s College of Communication and a Masters of Fine Arts in Theatre Management and Producing from Columbia University’s Graduate School of the Arts.
